# MeshQuery UI/UX Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to fix pagination issues, UI jitter, and data accuracy problems across the MeshQuery web interface.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Packets Page Pagination Fix
**Problem:** Packets page showed only 7 entries despite having 35,000+ packets in the database.

**Solution:**
- Restored default page size from 10 to 25 entries per page (`src/malla/templates/packets.html`)
- Added `has_more` hint in API responses to support grouped/estimated queries (`src/malla/routes/api_routes.py`)
- Updated `ModernTable` component to respect `has_more` flag for pagination controls (`src/malla/static/js/modern-table.js`)
- Fixed pagination logic for grouped queries to enable "Next" button when more data is available

**Files Modified:**
- `src/malla/templates/packets.html` - Line 531: Changed pageSize back to 25
- `src/malla/routes/api_routes.py` - Added `has_more` to response metadata
- `src/malla/database/repositories.py` - Added `has_more` calculation in PacketRepository
- `src/malla/static/js/modern-table.js` - Enhanced pagination logic to use `has_more` hint

---

### 2. Traceroute Pagination Enhancement
**Problem:** Traceroute page showed low number of results with pagination issues similar to packets.

**Solution:**
- Applied same `has_more` pagination fix to traceroute endpoints
- Enhanced TracerouteRepository to return pagination hints for grouped queries

**Files Modified:**
- `src/malla/routes/api_routes.py` - Added `has_more` to traceroute API response
- `src/malla/database/repositories.py` - Added `has_more` calculation in TracerouteRepository

---

### 3. Longest Links Calculation Correction
**Problem:** Multi-hop distance calculations were incorrect, showing straight-line distances instead of sum of hop segments.

**Solution:**
- Rewrote multi-hop distance calculation to sum individual hop segment distances
- Single-hop links continue to use Tier B pipeline (direct RF links)
- Multi-hop links now properly aggregate distances from `traceroute_hops` table

**Files Modified:**
- `src/malla/services/traceroute_service.py` - Lines 440-580: Complete rewrite of multi-hop distance calculation

**Technical Details:**
- Query now joins `traceroute_hops` with `packet_history` to get hop coordinates
- Calculates distance between consecutive hops using Haversine formula
- Sums all hop distances for total path length
- Filters out paths with missing GPS data

---

### 4. Map Page Jitter Fix
**Problem:** Map camera would jitter and jump during auto-refresh every 3 seconds.

**Solution:**
- Disabled animation on `setView()` during auto-refresh
- Only restore view if it actually changed during data reload
- Added tolerance check (0.0001 degrees) to prevent fighting with user pan/zoom

**Files Modified:**
- `src/malla/templates/map.html` - Lines 1874-1890: Smart view restoration logic

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Before: Always animated setView every 3 seconds
map.setView(currentCenter, currentZoom);

// After: Only restore if changed, no animation
const centerMoved = Math.abs(newCenter.lat - currentCenter.lat) > 0.0001 || 
                   Math.abs(newCenter.lng - currentCenter.lng) > 0.0001;
if (centerMoved || zoomChanged) {
    map.setView(currentCenter, currentZoom, { animate: false });
}
```

---

### 5. Live Topography Impossible Links Fix
**Problem:** Live topography showed impossible long-distance links (e.g., Seattle to New York) for multi-hop packets.

**Solution:**
- Filter packets to only animate DIRECT RF links (hop_count = 0 or hop_start = hop_limit)
- Added 800km distance limit to filter out impossible RF links
- Multi-hop packets still counted in statistics but not animated
- Added Haversine distance calculation function

**Files Modified:**
- `src/malla/static/js/live-topography.js` - Lines 180-257: Enhanced packet filtering and distance checking

**Technical Details:**
```javascript
// Check if packet is direct RF link
const isDirect = (hopStart === hopLimit) || (hopCount === 0);

// Calculate distance and filter
const distance = calculateDistance(fromNode.lat, fromNode.lng, toNode.lat, toNode.lng);
if (distance > 800) {
    // Skip animation but count in stats
    console.warn(`Skipping impossible link: ${distance.toFixed(1)}km`);
    return;
}
```

## Testing

After rebuilding and restarting the Docker containers, verify:

1. **Packets Page:**
   - Navigate to `/packets`
   - Verify page shows 25 entries per page
   - Click "Next" button and verify it advances beyond page 1
   - Total count should show 35,000+ packets

2. **Traceroutes Page:**
   - Navigate to `/traceroute`
   - Enable "Group by Packet ID"
   - Verify multi-page results with working pagination

3. **Longest Links Page:**
   - Navigate to `/longest-links`
   - Verify single-hop distances are reasonable (< 200km typically)
   - Verify multi-hop distances show sum of hop segments, not straight-line

4. **Map Page:**
   - Navigate to `/map`
   - Observe auto-refresh every 3 seconds
   - Verify camera does NOT jump or jitter
   - Pan/zoom manually and verify view stays stable during refresh

5. **Live Topography:**
   - Navigate to `/live-topography`
   - Click "Start Live"
   - Verify only short-distance links are animated
   - No long cross-country lines should appear

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Pagination uses server-side limits and offsets
- Grouped queries use estimated counts for performance
- Live updates refresh every 3 seconds (map) or real-time (topography)

### Future Optimizations (TODO)
1. Add database indexes on frequently queried columns:
   - `packet_history(timestamp, from_node_id, to_node_id)`
   - `traceroute_hops(packet_id, hop_index)`
   - `packet_history(gateway_id, timestamp)` for filtered queries

2. Consider caching for:
   - Node location lookups
   - Recent packet counts
   - Traceroute path calculations

3. Add integration tests for:
   - Pagination edge cases
   - Longest links calculations
   - Live update performance

---

## Browser Cache Note

If changes don't appear immediately after deployment:
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache for localhost:8080
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify Docker container is running the new image: `docker compose ps`

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, revert changes:
```bash
cd E:\MeshQuery
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/malla/templates/packets.html
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/malla/static/js/live-topography.js
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/malla/templates/map.html
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/malla/services/traceroute_service.py
docker compose build --no-cache malla-web
docker compose up -d
```
