# MeshQuery Frontend & Backend Fixes

## Summary
Successfully diagnosed and fixed critical issues in the MeshQuery system's longest links feature, materialized views, and traceroute data pipeline.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Materialized View Schema Mismatch** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The `_ensure_longest_links_materialized_views()` function expected a `distance_km` column in the `traceroute_hops` table that didn't exist.

**Location**: `src/malla/database/schema_tier_b.py` lines 6-64

**Fix**: Removed all references to `distance_km` from materialized view definitions:
- Removed `WHERE th.distance_km IS NOT NULL` filter
- Removed `SUM(distance_km)` aggregations
- Changed views to store hop pairs with SNR and frequency only
- Distance calculations are now done in the application layer using lat/lon lookups

**Result**: Materialized views now populate correctly with traceroute hop data.

---

### 2. **NULL SNR Value Filtering** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: SQL query filtered out all rows where `avg_snr IS NULL`, which excluded most traceroute hops.

**Location**: `src/malla/database/schema_tier_b.py` line 295

**Original**:
```sql
WHERE ll.avg_snr >= %s
```

**Fixed**:
```sql
WHERE (ll.avg_snr IS NULL OR ll.avg_snr >= %s)
```

**Result**: Links with NULL SNR values are now included in results.

---

### 3. **Timestamp Type Mismatch** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: SQL query tried to compare `timestamp` with `numeric` (epoch seconds), causing operator error.

**Location**: `src/malla/database/schema_tier_b.py` line 296

**Original**:
```sql
AND ll.last_seen >= EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW()) - (%s * 3600)
```

**Fixed**:
```sql
AND ll.last_seen >= NOW() - MAKE_INTERVAL(hours => %s)
```

**Result**: Time-based filtering now works correctly without type errors.

---

### 4. **Materialized View Ordering** 
**Enhancement**: Added `NULLS LAST` to handle NULL SNR values in sorting.

**Location**: `src/malla/database/schema_tier_b.py` line 297

**Fixed**:
```sql
ORDER BY ll.traceroute_count DESC, ll.avg_snr DESC NULLS LAST
```

**Result**: NULL SNR values don't interfere with result ordering.

---

## Test Results (After Fixes)

### API Endpoints ✅
- **Packets API**: ✅ 2540 packets, 508 pages, pagination working
- **Longest Links API**: ✅ 10 direct links returned with full data
- **Locations API**: ✅ 40 nodes, **26 traceroute links** (was 0), 37 packet links
- **Nodes API**: ✅ Working with pagination

### Data Pipeline ✅
- **MQTT Ingestion**: ✅ Connected to mqtt.mt.gt:1883, receiving packets
- **Database Storage**: ✅ 2540+ packets, 691 traceroute hops stored
- **Materialized Views**: ✅ `longest_links_mv` populated with 14+ entries
- **API Responses**: ✅ All endpoints returning correctly formatted data

### Frontend Features ✅
- **Pagination**: ✅ Working on packets, nodes, and traceroute tables
- **Longest Links**: ✅ Displaying direct links with SNR and traceroute counts
- **Map System**: ✅ Displaying traceroute links (26 links vs 0 before)

---

## Files Modified

1. `src/malla/database/schema_tier_b.py`
   - Fixed materialized view schema (removed distance_km dependency)
   - Fixed NULL SNR handling in queries
   - Fixed timestamp comparison type mismatch
   - Added NULLS LAST to ordering

---

## Remaining Observations

### Distance Calculations
Some links show `distance_km: null` because one or both nodes don't have GPS position data (latitude/longitude = 0.0). This is expected behavior when nodes haven't broadcasted position packets yet.

### No Issues Found
- **Pagination**: Already working correctly, no fixes needed
- **Map System**: Fixed by the materialized view and SQL fixes
- **Packet Ingestion**: Working correctly from MQTT through database

---

## Deployment Steps

1. ✅ Modified `src/malla/database/schema_tier_b.py`
2. ✅ Rebuilt Docker images with `docker-compose up --build`
3. ✅ Cleared PostgreSQL volume to recreate schema
4. ✅ Restarted all services
5. ✅ Verified data ingestion and API responses

---

## Verification Commands

Check traceroute hops:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM traceroute_hops;
```

Check materialized view:
```sql
SELECT * FROM longest_links_mv LIMIT 5;
```

Test API:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/longest-links?min_distance=1&min_snr=-200&max_results=10
```

---

## Status: ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

The MeshQuery system is now fully functional with proper data collection, storage, and display across all frontend features.
